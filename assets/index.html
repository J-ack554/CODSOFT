             <br> This is our second year design project in collage,yes it was a group project.<br><br>An art portfolio is a collection of your work that showcases your skills, ideas, and development over a period of time. It demonstrates your creativity, personality, abilities, and commitment, and helps art schools and universities evaluate your potential. In the context of art school applications, a portfolio is a crucial component, often accompanied by a personal statement and/or an art school interview.
              It's a way to present your artistic abilities and style, and to stand out from other applicants.

             <br> This is our second year design project in collage,and is a collabrative group project.<br><br>  Creating a roll-a-ball game with C# involves using the Unity game engine.  First,we set up a project in Unity and design a simple 3D environment with a flat plane or other interesting terrain for the ball to roll on.  Then,we created a sphere object to represent the ball and add a Rigidbody component to it, enabling realistic physics simulation.  Optionally, we applied a C# script to control the ball's movement using player input like arrow keys.  Finally, we run the game in Unity and ball roll around the environment.  This is just the beginning! we can add complexity by implementing camera controls, creating goals or enemies, and designing different levels to make your roll-a-ball game even more engaging.</p>

             <br> This is our first year design project in collage,and is a group project.<br><br><b> Automatic Lighting Control:</b> You can use this setup to control an LED or other light source. When the light sensor detects low light levels (indicating darkness), the Arduino code can turn on the light. Conversely, the light can be turned off when sufficient light is present.
             <br><b>Data Logging:</b> The Arduino can record the light sensor readings over time, allowing you to analyze light patterns or track changes in ambient light.
             <br><b> Interactive Projects:</b> The light sensor data can be used in various interactive projects. For example, you could create a sound synthesizer that changes sound based on light levels or a plant monitor that measures light exposure for optimal plant growth.</p>
